        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Between the two of us, we have over 15 years of experience in the animal field. We’ve both worked with farm
            animals, exotic animals, reptiles, and of course, Dogs. As a prior veterinarian technician Jaylin has had
            experience delivering medication and vaccinations. We live and breathe animals, and can’t wait to help your
            family out anyway we can!</p>
